# Some Wei're Contracts

The smart contracts of the Some Wei're app 

Some Weiâ€™re is an Ethereum (exclusively for now) mobile dapp, for treasure hunts, allowing the users to bury a certain amount of ether or dig for ether at a location.

The dapp will allow any kind of event to be incentivized, whether it is a bycicle race, a hike, a trek, an escape game or a marketing event. The users will have the chance to win real ether. It is up to the organizers to communicate the hints to find the location of the treasure or treasures.
